We are given a graph taht represents a labyrinth.

In the first task, the heroes must navigate a labyrinth to escape while avoiding a dragon that closely follows and destroys rooms behind them. They have limited torches to light their way and need to collect enough gold from the labyrinth to pay off their debt, all while ensuring they don't get caught by the dragon or run out of resources.

The second task adds complexity by introducing a delay before the dragon starts its pursuit. The heroes must use this extra time wisely to gather necessary resources and gold before the dragon begins following their path. Once the delay ends, the dragon follows their freshest trail, so the heroes need to carefully plan their route to avoid being trapped.
